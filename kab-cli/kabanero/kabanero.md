## kabanero

kabanero

### Synopsis

Kabanero enables developers, architects, and operations to work together, 
faster. In a single solution, architects and operations can include their company’s 
standards for aspects like security and build pipelines into a customized stack that 
developers use. Kabanero gives enterprises the control they need for areas related 
to governance and compliance, while also meeting the developers’ need for agility 
and speed.

The kabanero command line tool is targetted at the developer.  It provides a mechanism
to get a set of governed application stacks from the Kabanero Application Hub, as well 
as learn about your role within the governed organization, what Git repos and docker
registries your code will be in, and where your test cluster is for combining your 
changes with others on your team.

Complete documentation is available at https://kabanero.io

to authenticate the user with kabanero instance.

By authenticating with the Kabanero instance, 
you will be able to use the Apphub 
which provides the set of collections that your
oorganization has established for you to use in developing
applications.  These collections have an appsody application
sstack inside them which will be used to create new 
projects.  Login will also enable you to test your code
on a test integration cluster with other members of your 
team.

## kabanero listCollections

show the list of named collections that can be used to create applications.

### Synopsis

A Kabanero collection is a governed set of meta-data
that provides pre-configured application structure, and deployment
information that allows the developer to focus on developing code. 
And once the code is stored in the source control system, the 
meta-data directs out the application is build and deployed into 
the develop downstream chain that gets it deployed into production
eventually. 

The critical piece of meta-data inside the kabanero collection is the 
Appsody stack. Appsody gives you pre-configured stacks and templates for a 
growing set of popular open source runtimes and frameworks, providing a 
foundation on which to build applications for Kubernetes and Knative deployments. 
This allows developers to focus on their code, reducing the learning curve for 
cloud-native developmentand enabling rapid development for these cloud-native 
applications.
